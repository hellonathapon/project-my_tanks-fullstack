## Overview
This is my very simple data-flow app to illustrate the efficiency of GraphQL for API handling
  - Create Express server integreted with GraphQL-Apollo to specify any up-comming query with schema language 
  - Make use Mongoose for modeling data to Database
  - Front-end simply makes all the requests to a single End-point to get API served
